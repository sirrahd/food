Food
====

Hungry but don't know what you want to eat? Food makes these tough decisions
for you. Using the Delivery.com API, Food searches for nearby restaurants that
are open, grabs random items from their menus, and schedules a delivery
straight to your door. If you're feeling lucky, the result can be a complete
surprise, or you can choose to confirm the order before it's placed.

This originally ran on Azure with a Microsoft SQL database. These settings can
be modified in settings.py.
